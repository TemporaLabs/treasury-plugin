# Every place this repository declares its own version must say the same thing.
#
# Why this is not bookkeeping: `package.json`'s version is a RUNTIME value, not metadata. The
# committed bundle reads `../package.json` at module load and reports what it finds as
# `serverInfo.version`, so the number in that file is what an MCP client is told it is talking to.
# The manifests are what the marketplace and the plugin hosts advertise. When they disagree, a user
# installing "0.1.0" gets a server that introduces itself as something else — measured on this
# repository: the identical bundle (`8a2296d8…`) reported `0.1.1` from one tree and `0.1.0` from
# another, decided entirely by `package.json`.
#
# They agreed at the v0.1.0 release and drifted apart at the v0.1.1 cut, when `package.json` alone
# was stamped. Nothing noticed, because nothing was looking.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/check-versions.sh            # all declarations must agree
#        bash scripts/check-versions.sh 0.1.1      # …and must equal this

# Hardcoded, like the file list in check-bundle-source.sh and for the same reason: a list read from
# data is a list that can be shortened, and a check that silently covers fewer declarations is the
# failure this exists to prevent. `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` is deliberately absent — that
# format carries no version field at all, so there is nothing there to disagree.
#
# Each entry is  <file>\t<python expression over the parsed document>
